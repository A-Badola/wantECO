		<h5 class="mb-4">Welcome to ecoWant</h5>
		<p class="text-justify mb-3">
			We, the team of ecoWant have created an online platform where everyone who want to lead an eco friendly and sustainable life, but don’t know how to and all who have created eco friendly and sustainable options but they don’t have a platform to make everyone aware about it can meet and get aware of each other and hence help in sustainable development.
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify mb-3">
			Currently we are a team of four but slowly it will get bigger and bigger and we will become a team of people all over the world who would be learning and teaching everyday to save our amazing planet Earth and its life.
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify mb-3">
			Our goal is to make more and more people aware about the sustainable options. And to appreciate the people who are working for and creating these options.
		</p>
		<h5 class="my-4">Origin</h5>
		<p class="text-justify mb-3">
			We got the idea for creating a platform like this by a TV show called Eco India which used to show various eco friendly and innovative ways to fulfill our daily requirements which usually causes harmful effects for different lives on the Earth.
		</p>
		<h5 class="my-4">Team</h5>
		<p class="text-justify mb-3">
			We are a team of four members who are currently pursuing Btech in computer science.	Being a student we have always studied the importance of sustainability and how we are not leading a sustainable life though sometimes we really want to. We created WantECO to make people like us aware about these great things happening around us.
